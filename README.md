# ARM-TemperatureSensor
In this project,with the help of 3 essential components(STM32 Smart V2.0 , 2*16 LCD , LM35 sensor),an operational example of a temperature reader device is built.
The information recieved from LM35 is interpreted within the STM32f103C8T6 microcontroller and then displayed on the LCD screen.
Note : the LM35 sensor is not a very reliable temperature sensor and it could give us imprecise data.
This ARM program was built with Keil and STM32Cube.
Also you can contact me if you are need of the whole project and it's files
